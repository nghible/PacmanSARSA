# PacmanSARSA
My second submission to the Pacman coursework in Machine Learning class at King's College London.

## Paraphrase of Coursework:

This coursework solves the Pacman game using a basic SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm. Details of SARSA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State%E2%80%93action%E2%80%93reward%E2%80%93state%E2%80%93action

The implementation is in the "mlLearningAgents.py" file.

To run the algorithm, type into the terminal:

python pacman.py -p QLearnAgent -x 2000 -n 2010 -l smallGrid

The algorithm will be trained on 2000 games and will be tested on 10 games. smallGrid is the map.
